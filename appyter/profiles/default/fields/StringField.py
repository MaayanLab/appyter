  :param choices: (Union[List[str], Dict[str, str]]) A set of choices that are available for this field or lookup table mapping from choice label to resulting value
  :param required: (Optional[bool]) Whether or not this field is required (defaults to false)
  :param default: (str) A default value as an example and for use during prototyping
  :param examples: (Optional[Union[List[str], Dict[str, str]]]) Named strings to provide as clickable examples
