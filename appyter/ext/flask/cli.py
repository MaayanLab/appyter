    loading more commands from the configured Flask app.  Normally a
    developer does not have to interface with this class but there are
    some very advanced use cases for which it makes sense to create an
    instance of this. see :ref:`custom-scripts`.
    :param add_default_commands: if this is True then the default run and
        shell commands will be added.
    :param add_version_option: adds the ``--version`` option.
    :param create_app: an optional callback that is passed the script info and
        returns the loaded app.
    :param load_dotenv: Load the nearest :file:`.env` and :file:`.flaskenv`
        files to set environment variables. Will also change the working
        directory to the directory containing the first file found.
    :param set_debug_flag: Set the app's debug flag based on the active
        environment
    .. versionchanged:: 1.0
        If installed, python-dotenv will be used to load environment variables
        from :file:`.env` and :file:`.flaskenv` files.
